Spelling and natural language mixing were retained. The sample is small, uses English prompts and includes context-dependent answers. It does not represent all Sheng speakers. Respondents may occur in more than one split. Per-intent counts are in reports/split_counts.csv; sources and changes are in SOURCE_LOG.csv and our review records in assessment/.
